# Logo Generator
Module 10 Challenge

## Description
The task was to create a backend application capable of creating simple logos based on a short list of questions.

## Difficulties

### Classes
There was difficulty getting the classes to connect and work cohesively. At a point the application ran fine, upon reaching the render point the application stopped working as well and no longer allowed for proper running.

### SVG file creation
Due to the classes not working the errors keep being thrown before the creation of the SVG file which can then never be made.

### Tests
Could not create tests because the application was not functional.
